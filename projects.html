<h2 id="eigengrausgenerator">Eigengrau's Generator</h2>

<p>I created <a href="www.eigengrausgenerator.com">Eigengrau's Generator</a>, a SugarCube app that creates randomly generated towns for fantasy settings like Dungeons and Dragons. This was my first foray into code, and I found that it was quite enjoyable. Follow my posts tagged #eigengrau for updates on the generator.</p>

<h2 id="artmusicmemes">Art Music Memes</h2>

<p>I am the editor (read: chief trash lord) of <a href="www.facebook.com/artmusicmemes">Art Music Memes</a>. I make bad memes related to classical music. I've sometimes even been paid to do so. I've cultivated a fanbase of over 30,000 middle to upper-class socioeconomic followers, with the 18-24 demographic making up over 60% of these followers; a valuable and elusive group for the classical music industry. For sponsored posts on the page, you can contact me at <a href="mailto:contact@rhysgraymusic.com">contact@rhysgraymusic.com</a>.

<h2 id="musicianssociety">Musicians Society</h2>

<p>I was the founding president of the Tasmania University Union Musician's Society, which is the peak body of representation amongst the University of Tasmania community.</p>
