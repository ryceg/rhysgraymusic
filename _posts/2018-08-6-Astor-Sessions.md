Well, that's a wrap! I just finished Music Tasmania's [Astor Sessions](https://www.musictasmania.org/whats-happening/the-astor-sessions) weekend at the Astor Hotel in Hobart, and have come out the other end with a newfound appreciation for the work that goes into creating a 15 second Instagram clip (and a slight hangover!)

I had a great time hanging out with the two leading ladies of [Ysla](https://www.facebook.com/music.isla/), Anna Williams and Crystal Livermore. It was a really different experience to my usual workflow of cordoning myself off from humanity with Sibelius, and then producing a whole piece by my lonesome. It was a lot of fun, and I really enjoyed the change of pace in creating a musical work.

Can't wait to see the results- Moo Brew were amazing to work with, as were the nine other musicians and tutors Monique Brumby, Grant Gillies, and Ryan of [Akouo](https://www.facebook.com/akouo/). Huge thanks to Music Tasmania for putting it on!
