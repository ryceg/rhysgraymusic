I'm very excited to announce that I've been selected as one of ten people to participate in Music Tasmania's [Astor Sessions](https://www.musictasmania.org/whats-happening/the-astor-sessions)! 

> Presented by Music Tasmania and Gaga Music, the weekend retreat brings together 10 Tasmanian songwriters with ARIA Award-winner Monique Brumby and Producer Ryan Farrington (AKA Akouo) to write, record, and share music, while receiving industry mentoring from some of the best in the business.

I'll be posting a link to my rescoring of the Tourism Tasmania 'Feed Your Curious' campaign video on here (as soon as I ensure that I have the rights to do so!)

I'm really looking forward to this- a weekend of drinking beer and playing with other musos? Paradise!
