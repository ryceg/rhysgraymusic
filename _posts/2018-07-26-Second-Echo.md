Pre-sales for Second Echo Ensemble's "Contested Land" show have just started! I was lucky enough to participate in this wonderful project in early 2017, where I composed a short piece, which was recorded by the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra. You can listen to it [here](https://soundcloud.com/user-427073505/the-contest-by-rhys-gray)!

A dear colleague of mine, [Tom Misson](https://www.facebook.com/tjmisson/) was also involved in the project, and wrote the 'love' theme, while I wrote the 'war' music. It was a bit of a role-reversal; usually I'm the one to write sappy stuff, while he has such bangers as his Piano Sonata and 'Saturday Night Tuberculosis'.

Second Echo Ensemble are a fantastic group, and received rave reviews for their production 'By My Hand' which was on earlier in the year. 'Contested Land' will surely not be one to miss.
